# Geometric Shape Analyzer
## Overview
This Java application is a collaborative personal project developed to model and analyze geometric shapes such as Parallelograms, Diamonds, Rectangles, and Squares within a class hierarchy. It showcases an in-depth understanding of object-oriented principles like inheritance, method overriding, and the Java Math package, with a focus on creating a versatile and reusable code structure.

## Features
- **Class Hierarchy**: Implements a comprehensive hierarchy with a base 'Shape' class and derived classes for specific geometric figures.
- **Calculations**: Features methods to accurately calculate the area and circumference for each shape.
- **Display Information**: Outputs detailed information about each shape, including dimensions, area, and perimeter.

## How to Run
- Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system.
- Compile and execute the Main class to interact with the shapes and view calculated results.

## Collaboration
This project was a collaborative effort between myself and a fellow programming enthusiast. We aimed to refine our Java skills and delve into the nuances of object-oriented design.
